# EliteMeritTracker
EDMC-Plugin to track Powerplay Merits

Last session will be recalculated on logoff/login

Currently manual tracking of merits when in a system. Features for reediting will be added. 
No data will be exported, all held locally as long as EDMC is running, or overall merits safed as power.json locally.

When fdev gives us some journal love, automatic tracking will be implemented.
